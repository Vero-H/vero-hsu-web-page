## Welcome to Vero Hsu's GitHub Pages

We are going to start out a new journey from scratch! I will document what I learn along the way, content and designs may be a bit messy to start with, but that's the learning curve.

Never too late to start something new and learn that thing you have always wanted to discover! I have not given coding any thoughts as I was never good at math or algebra and so I have neglected the fact that I was good at picking up the computer and new technology stuff since I was little.

I'm about three weeks in trying to understand what does the coding world has to offer.  I have been just researching and trying to figure out which language is for what purposes, and binge-watching youtube videos of all sort of the great developers sharing their insights to their different yet very wonderful experiences.

This is my first attempt to create my first webpage, but I'm going to build a whole lot of cool pages and hopefully will be able to code soon!

Next up, other than a strong portfolio. I will document my journey, as a tech newbie of learning how to code from ZERO experience and never muddled in the tech field in late 2020 where the world had slapped me in the face and told me to get going with my little precious life on earth and learn something! Just get up and do something while I can, cherish the crazy amount of resources that are all within reach and so accessible!

**peace out for today**
